\section{Documentation}

When you load the package \texttt{showhyphens} in your \LuaLaTeX\ document, \LaTeX\ will show all possible hyphenation points. This
package requires you to process the document with \LuaLaTeX.

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{showhyphens}

\begin{document}
A wonderful serenity has taken
possession of my entire soul, like these
sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy
with my whole heart. I am alone, and
feel the charm of existence in this
spot, which was created for the bliss of
souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear
friend, so absorbed in the exquisite
sense of mere tranquil existence, that I
neglect my talents. I should be
incapable of drawing a single stroke at
the present moment; and yet I feel that
I never was a greater artist than now.

\section{Bugs and limitations}

% see http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/268884
Ligatures will give incorrect results.  For example \enquote{office} gives:
offi'ce but should show of'fice instead. While it is possible to look inside
the ffi ligature and find out where the original hyphen character was placed
(between the first f and the following component fi), it is very hard to draw
the line indicating the hyphenation point correctly. The ffi ligature is one
opaque rectangle to the package. Drawing a line at the correct position is
pure luck, and therefore out of the scope of the package.
